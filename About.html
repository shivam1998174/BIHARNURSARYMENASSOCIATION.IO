            <h2>A network of strength, support, and success</h2>
            <p>In the current scenario of Climate Change & depleting Ground Water,
                the weather patterns are disrupting the usual balance of nature.
                This pose many risks to human beings and all other forms of life on earth.
                Changes in temperature causes changes in rainfall & this leads to several problems like,
                drought in some areas & floods in others. The only solution to this problem is large
                scale plantation & conservation of ground water & controlled usages of natural resources.
                In this mission of saving our mother nature, we all need to contribute & this can happen only
                when we can connect it with the entire population of the state & the country. Now that’s where
                we Nurserymen & Progreesive Farmers decided to take this task in our hand & we as GREEN WARRIOR
                will lead from the front in this mission. We will work on large scale plantation drive & ground
                water conservation program in association with the Government, Private Institutions, NGOs, Corporates,
                Schools & Colleges.
