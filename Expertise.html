                <h1>Ornamental Plants and Seedlings</h1>
                <p>
                    By ornamental plant, we mean all plants grown in private or public plots for its ornamental qualities,
                    rather than for its commercial or economic value. Apart from several functions played by plants
                    in the environment, ornamental plants have a more particular role in the life of man, namely aesthetics.
                    They play especially a role in the psychic balance of the man. The importance of ornamental plants
                    is as much on man as on the economic point of view, especially in the large modern cities where the
                    process of rapid urbanization has caused collective dwellings and large constructions to spring from the ground.
                    Ornamental plants can belong to different categories depending on the desired effect and the location
                    in which it is desired to grow them. It can be herbaceous, annual, biennial or perennial plants, woody
                    plants, trees, shrubs, climbing plants or falling foliage.

                            Spices and herbs are defined as plant derived substances that add flavor to any dish.
                            It is difficult to distinguish between the two. Spices can come from the following plant parts:
                            roots, rhizomes, stems, leaves, bark, flowers, fruits, and seeds.
                            Herbs are typically thought of as non-woody plants.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It is not known when humans began to use the first herbs and spices
                            as flavoring agents. Garlic and onions were documented as being used 4,500 years before present.
                            Humans used spices to help preserve foods before refrigeration. Both were also used in religious ceremonies.

                <p>
                    Deciding which plants to use for your home’s landscape can be a challenge.
                    Many factors must be considered, beyond simply choosing the plants you find to be the most attractive.
                    You’ll need to consider your climate and the amount of time you want to devote to maintenance.
                    You’ll also need to find plants suitable for exposure conditions,
                    such as sun or shade or dry or rainy weather.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, you should think about what you want your plants to achieve. Are you looking
                    to add shade or privacy to your property? Do you want something fragrant and colorful that will attract birds,
                    butterflies and other wildlife? You should also select landscape plantings that reflect the style of your garden.
                    Most plants suitable for a quaint cottage-style
                    garden will look out of place in a garden with a sultry Mediterranean or tropical theme.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Available landscaping plants are as following:
                    forsyhtia, vinca minor, texas ranger, yew, barberry,
                    bottlebrush buckeye, fescue, bergenia,

                        <h1> Horticulture Products</h1>
                        <p>
                            Horticultural products include all products, raw or processed, that arise from the horticultural industry.
                            This broadly inclusive definition is appropriate and even necessary in a time when
                            traceability from the producer to the ultimate consumer is of growing interest to government and industry.
                            Products from horticultural industry that go to market still respiring (fresh produce) are clearly horticultural products.
                            When juiced, sliced or pureed, fermented, frozen, preserved, canned, dried, irradiated, or used in an ornamental construct
                            (such as a flower arrangement) they remain, in our view, a horticultural product.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, when a horticultural product becomes a major ingredient of another manufactured item the
                            categorization becomes more complex. Thus, when apples are used to make apple pie or yogurt is
                            fortified with fruit, the product can be considered both a horticultural product and a bakery or
                            dairy product.
